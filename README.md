# FitCore Studio Gym Website

This project generates a complete gym/fitness website using a single category prompt (Mode 1). It uses Tailwind CSS via CDN and provides three production-ready pages:

- index.html: Home page with hero, programs, features, testimonials, and gallery.
- about.html: About page with team and mission.
- contact.html: Contact form and location details.

Design and content choices follow the gym/fitness theme with a high-energy, modern aesthetic. All pages are responsive and accessible.

How to run
- Open the three HTML files in a modern browser (no server required).
- The site uses Tailwind classes for styling. No external CSS files are used.

Fonts and typography
- Typography is selected to match the Gym/Fitness category: Oswald for headings and Roboto/Open Sans for body text as appropriate.
- Font classes are applied via Tailwind utility classes (font-[Oswald], font-[Roboto], etc.).

Color and visuals
- The gym color scheme emphasizes energetic contrasts and bold accents. The hero section uses a full-width background image placeholder (https://source.unsplash.com/random/1600x900/?...) with a dark overlay for readability.

Accessibility
- All images include alt attributes. The navigation is keyboard accessible. Buttons have clear hover and focus states.

Notes
- Placeholders like https://source.unsplash.com/random/1600x900/?... are included for hero/background and gallery images and can be swapped with real assets later.
